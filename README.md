**Geometric Algorithms Visualization in Flutter**
This Flutter project provides visualizations for two popular geometric algorithms: Graham's Scan and Quick Hull. Geometric algorithms are widely used in computational geometry for solving various problems related to geometric shapes and structures.

**Features**
Graham's Scan Visualization: This feature visualizes the Graham's Scan algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points in the plane.
Quick Hull Visualization: This feature visualizes the Quick Hull algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points in the plane.
